## Quick Start

### Step 1: Install the Plugin

Although it is a commercial plugin, you can download and test the plugin in your local environment before purchasing it.

#### Composer

The recommended way to install the plugin is via Composer. To install the plugin, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
composer require johannschopplich/kirby-copilot
```

::callout{icon="i-ri-information-line"}
Prior to v1.3, the plugin was published on a private Composer repository. It is now available on Packagist and can be installed without authentication. Your license key remains the same and is still required in production environments. To migrate your license key to the new location, follow these steps:

- Open a Panel page that contains the Copilot section.
- Your license key is **is automatically migrated** from the `auth.json` file in your root directory to the new location in the `/site/config/.kirby-tools-licenses` file.
- Update your `.gitignore` file to exclude the new license file.

You can remove the `repo.kirby.tools` repository configuration from your `composer.json` file.

#### Download

Head over to the [releases page](https://github.com/kirby-tools/kirby-copilot/releases) and download the latest version of the plugin as a ZIP file. Extract the contents of this ZIP file to your `site/plugins` folder. It should look like this:

```
site/plugins/
├─ kirby-copilot/
│  └─ … All plugin files
```

### Step 2: AI Provider Configuration

Configure the AI provider by setting the **API key** and **AI model** in the global Kirby configuration. Each provider has its own configuration key. To get started with OpenAI, create a new [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and add it to the configuration along with the AI model such as GPT-4o:

```php [config.php]
return [
    'johannschopplich.copilot' => [
        'providers' => [
            'openai' => [
                'model' => 'gpt-4o',
                'apiKey' => 'YOUR_API_KEY'
            ]
        ]
    ]
];
```

::callout{icon="i-ri-error-warning-line" color="amber"}
We recommend to create a unique API key for each project. This way, you can easily revoke access to the API key if needed.
::

### Step 3: Blueprint Setup

To display the Copilot section in the Kirby Panel, add a section of type `copilot` to your blueprint:

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
sections:
  copilot:
    type: copilot
    field: blocks
```

The only required section property is `field`. This is the target field of the Kirby model that will be used to write the generated text to.

::callout{icon="i-ri-information-line"}
Supported field types are `blocks`, `writer`, `textarea` and `text`. Other field types will be added in the future if there is enough demand.
::

After adding the section, you can start using the plugin in the Kirby Panel. The accordion will be closed by default:

::preview{src="/img/copilot-section-closed.png"}
::

Click on the arrow to open the accordion and start entering your prompt:

::preview{src="/img/copilot-section-open.png"}
::

### Step 4: Buy a License

You can test the plugin locally. However, you need to purchase a license to use the plugin in production environments.

Visit the [product page on Lemon Squeezy](https://byjohann.lemonsqueezy.com/buy/ce8a5fd2-8a01-4972-9a5d-e9dbbca17acf) and purchase a license. Then, open any Panel page that contains the SEO Audit section. Click the **Activate** link to open the activation form:

:prose-video{src="/vid/kirby-copilot-activation.mp4" poster="/vid/kirby-copilot-activation-poster.jpg" width="908" height="540"}

Enter the email you used for the purchase and the order number and hit the submit button. Done! Thanks for supporting our work. Once you activate your license, the license activation buttons will disappear.

::callout{icon="i-ri-information-line"}
Your license key will be automatically stored in the `/site/config/.kirby-tools-licenses` file. Make sure to add this file to your `.gitignore` file to keep your license key private.
